Version 0.1.6
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: 2011-04-24

Notes:
 - Sensor devices are now being managed by colord to make calibration a
   nicer experience in the desktop. At the moment only taking spot
   colors is supported, and only the huey driver is available.
 - Applications can now request profiles for standard color spaces such
   as sRGB, AdobeRGB and ProPhotoRGB.
 - Lots of system performance improvements, but be sure to use g-c-m
   from git for the fastest session startup.

New Features:
 - Add 3 tools for reverse engineering the huey colorimeter
 - Add a DBus interface designed so normal users can use color sensors
 - Add a dummy sensor object that is enabled if 'CreateDummySensor' is set
 - Add an async version of CdClient:Connect()
 - Add a --verbose command line option to print the debugging in color
 - Add CdColor to libcolord so we have some reusable GTypes to use
 - Add cd-create-profile, which provides a way to build a NCP
 - Add GetStandardSpace to the DBus API
 - Add support for sensor devices in libcolord
 - Add get-sensors and get-sensor-reading commands to the colormgr tool
 - Add the native Huey sensor driver which is taken from gnome-color-manager
 - Add two options to colord: --timed-exit and --immediate-exit
 - Import the sensor udev rules file from gnome-color-manager
 - Move gcm-fix-profile from GNOME Color Manager as cd-fix-profile
 - Update the architecture plan to include sensor devices

Bugfixes:
 - Do not emit a critical warning if ID_MODEL doesn't exist for a device
 - Remove any .icc suffix automatically from the encoded profile title
 - Return an error if the user tries to create a persistent profile
 - The DTP92 cannot profile LCDs, according to Graeme
 - Use cmsOpenProfileFromFile() rather than getting the complete profile content
 - Use the embedded profile-id if it is available, else fallback to the file MD5
 - Use the FILE_checksum metadata if it is available to speed up session startup

Version 0.1.5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: 2011-03-31

New Features:
 - Add a 'Metadata' property to the device object
 - Draft a specification document for device and profile IDs

Bugfixes:
 - Add AC_PROG_LIBTOOL to configure.ac to prevent a warning in jhbuild
 - Correct the spelling of colorimetric in the public API
 - Enable the sane support by default, Simple Scan needs this
 - Make any properties not understood by colord to be saved as metadata keys
 - Mark some more strings as translatable in colormgr

Version 0.1.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: 2011-01-13

Notes:
 - Colord is a simple system activated daemon that maps devices to color
   profiles.
 - It is used by gnome-color-manager for CUPS integration and is also
   used when there are no users logged in.
 - The only real user at the moment is CUPS, but GNOME Color Manager
   will start depending on colord when it is included in most mainstream
   distributions.
 - The DBus interface is not set in stone, and the libcolord library
   will have new API added to it as required. If colord needs to break
   public API at this stage for a specific use case, it will.
 - The persistent storage code is not written yet, but that will come
   with the next colord version.

New Features:
 - Add a 'Kind' attribute to the device objects (Richard Hughes)
 - Add a libcolord shared library that can be used in the client tools (Richard Hughes)
 - Add an example spec file (Richard Hughes)
 - Add a simple colormgr man page (Richard Hughes)
 - Add a simple GTK test GUI for testing the DBus interfaces (Richard Hughes)
 - Add a simple script to create a test device (Richard Hughes)
 - Add basic DBus interface (Richard Hughes)
 - Add code for the DeleteDevice method (Richard Hughes)
 - Add DeleteProfile() on the main interface (Richard Hughes)
 - Add GetProfileForQualifier() code (Richard Hughes)
 - Add MakeProfileDefault() implementation to CdDevice (Richard Hughes)
 - Add qualifiers to profiles (Richard Hughes)
 - Allow clients to set properties on the objects using SetProperty (Richard Hughes)
 - Expose the device created time (Richard Hughes)
 - Fixed typo in ColorManager API description (Tim Waugh)
 - Open the profile using lcms2 after we set the profile filename (Richard Hughes)
 - Provide a method to assign an ICC profile to a profile object (Richard Hughes)
 - Provide methods for mapping the device ID to the object path (Richard Hughes)
 - Use seporate PolicyKit authorisations for each action type (Richard Hughes)

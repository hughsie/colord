colord
======

colord is a system service that makes it easy to manage, install and generate
color profiles to accurately color manage input and output devices.

This functionality is implemented as a system activated daemon called colord.
Being system activated means that it's only started when the user is using a
text mode or graphical tool.

What colord does:

* Provides a DBus API for other programs to query, e.g.
  "Get me the profiles for device $foo" or
  "Create a device and assign it profile $bar"

* Provides a persistent database backed store for device -> profile mapping.

* Provides the session for a way to set system settings, for instance
  setting the display profile for all users and all sessions.

See [the website](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/colord/) for more details.

            --disable-polkit                        \
            --disable-print-profiles                \
            --disable-sane                          \
            --disable-session-example               \
            --disable-systemd                 \
            --disable-udev                          \
            --disable-unix                          \
            --without-pic                           \
            --with-systemdsystemunitdir=/tmp        \
            --with-udevrulesdir=/tmp && make

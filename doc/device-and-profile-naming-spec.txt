= Introduction =

This document will explain the device and profile ID schemes used by
GNOME Color Manager and colord in the hope that other CMS solutions
will hopefully interoperate with this specification.

Also, by codifying the device and profile identifiers it is expected
that applications can directly query colord.
This would allow, for instance, a scanning application that has a
libsane SANE_Device object to easily get the device ID for the colord
device that corresponds to that physical device.

It also means that the CMS does not have to understand concepts like
the EDID vendor or the printer name, and can match and apply policy to
devices just by comparing simple strings.
This also allows applications to create new types of devices and
profiles in the CMS without the CMS being aware of all the nuances of
what the application is trying to do.

For an example, gnome-settings-daemon creates xrandr devices for colord
and also auto-creates profiles based on the device EDID.
When this happens, colord saves the device->profile mapping and on next
session start re-maps the devices which causes the session policy the
be applied in the gnome-settings-daemon color plugin.

In this way, the CMS knows nothing about XRandR and everything works
transparently and correctly.

= Device ID Format =

A device ID is designed to be able to represent a physical device on the
local machine. A device ID is not supposed to be unique across multiple
workstations with identical hardware.

The device ID is also color management specific. For instance, a CRT or
LCD screen may vary a great deal from unit to unit, and so the serial
number is used in the device ID. A webcam however, does not typically
vary unit-to-unit by much at all, and so the device serial number is not
used in video4linux device IDs.

A device ID is a valid UTF-8 string. This means it can contain slashes
and spaces and does not have to be escaped.

== XRANDR Display Device ==

A XRandR device consists of a single physical display device.
A colord device should not be created for a display interface that does
not have a physical device attached to it.

A XRandR device typically has the device EDID data available, and this
is the prefered way of identifying the device. Using the EDID ensures
the device ID remains constant if the physical display connection is
moved from VGA to DVI1 for instance.

Format:		xrandr[-{%edid_vendor}][-{%edid_model][-{%edid_serial}]
Example:	xrandr-Hewlett Packard-HP LP2480zx-3CM82200KV
Example:	xrandr-3CM82200KV

For some displays, the EDID may be corrupt or not available.
In this case, the fallback scheme is used using the XRandR device name.

Format:		xrandr-{%xrandr_name}
Example:	xrandr-LVDS1

Projects already using this format:
 * GNOME Color Manager

== CUPS printer ==

A CUPS printer is a single physical printing device with queue in CUPS.

A colord device should not be created for an printer that does not
have a suitable driver yet installed.

The device ID is constructed using

Format:		cups-{%printer_name}
Example:	cups-Photosmart-B109a-m

Projects already using this format:
 * GNOME Color Manager
 * CUPS
 * ghostscript
 * foomatic

== SANE scanner ==

A SANE scanner consists of a single physical scanning device.

Format:		sane-{%sane_model}
Example:	sane_Photosmart_B109a-m

Projects already using this format:
 * GNOME Color Manager

== Video4Linux devices ==

A video4linux device is typically a single physical web camera.

Format:		sysfs[-{%sysfs_vendor}][-{%sysfs_model]
Example:	sysfs-Chicony_Electronics_Co.__Ltd.-Integrated_Camera

For some hardware, the vendor and the model may not be available.
In this case, the fallback scheme is used using the device file.

Format:		sysfs-{%sysfs_device_file}
Example:	sysfs-/dev/video0

 * GNOME Color Manager

= Profile ID format =

The profile ID is a single string that identifies a specific profile
on a machine.

A profile ID is a valid UTF-8 string. This means it can contain slashes
and spaces and does not have to be escaped.

A profile ID is the same for binary identical profiles, even if
duplicated on the filesystem with the exception of user profiles.

In line with other ICC reccomendations, the embedded profile ID (bytes
84 to 99) is used, after converting it to a hexadecimal encoding.

The username is optionally appended to the profile ID as it is usually
not possible to reference profiles in other user accounts.
Any system-wide profiles added by the daemon will not include the
username suffix.

Format:		icc-{%embedded-profile-id}[-{%username}]
Example:	icc-3c219b18958837493b586581f8c2a2a4

The ICC do not mandate the embedded profile-id and only recommend it,
and as such few profiles in the wild use a real value.
If the embedded profile ID is not set, the complete MD5 file checksum
should be used instead, e.g.

Format:		icc-{%file-checksum}
Example:	icc-bd847723f676e2b846daaf6759330624

If a physical profile does not exist (for instance, for embedded printer
profiles) then a fallback is used, which is typically the printer name
and qualifier for the profile.

Format:		{%printer_name}[-{%qualifier}]
Example:	Photosmart-B109a-m-Gray..

Other fallbacks can be defined privately by applications if required.

# If we should always use the XRandR name as the DeviceId
#
# If the user has two or more outputs attached with identical EDID data then
# the client tools cannot tell them apart. By setting this value the 'xrandr-'
# style device-id is always used and the monitors will show up as seporate
# instances.
#
# This does of course mean that the calibration is referenced to the xrandr
# output name, rather than the monitor itself. This means that if the monitor
# cables are swapped then the wrong profile would be used.
